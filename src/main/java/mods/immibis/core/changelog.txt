57.1.4:
* Removed debug spam.

57.1.3:
* Might be required for Immibis's Microblocks 57.2.1.

57.1.2:

57.1.1:
* Fixed a bug causing an unreleased version of Advanced Machines to crash.
* Added config option to disable custom error screen.

57.1.0:
* Fixed /tps rounding.
* Added a config option to rename the /tps command, in case it conflicts with another mod.
* Added lowest TPS display to /tps command.
* Added an advanced config option to disable specific cross-mod compatibility (in case of breaking API changes in the future).
* Better client-side prediction for microblocks (in SMP).
* Contains incompatible API changes - requires update to Immibis's Microblocks (if you have it installed).

57.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.4.
* Fixed /tps formatting.

56.0.5:
* Required for Tubestuff 56.0.3.

56.0.4:
* Required for RedLogic 56.1.0.
* Disabled some ID sanity checks if IdFix is installed (same as if IDResolver is installed).

56.0.3:

56.0.2:
* Fixed duplicate entry in mod list.
* Fixed crash on startup on servers.

56.0.1:

54.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.1.

53.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.

52.4.7:
* Fixed IDs not being saved in the config if there's a conflict.

52.4.6:
* Possibly required update for Immibis's Microblocks 52.1.2.

52.4.5:

52.4.4:

52.4.3:
* Changed load order again, should fix FML crashes on startup.

52.4.2:
* Added detection of item ID conflicts.
* Added a thing telling FML to load this before all other mods if possible - fixes the IC2/microblocks load order problem.

52.4.1:
* Fixed a broken microblock-related method causing unpredictable server freezes, sorry Kane!

52.4.0:
* Separated microblocks into a separate coremod like they should have been from the start.
  You don't need to update configs. You do need to download Immibis's Microblocks if you
  had microblocks enabled, or they will disappear from the world.
  The API is still in Immibis Core.
* Immibis Core is back to not being a coremod. Sorry for any confusion.

52.3.7:
* Microblocks default to off again.
* Made microblocks always render with non-smooth lighting.
  This reduces graphical glitches but they are not fixed yet.
* NEI integration uses NBT instead of damage values like it should.
  Microblocks spawned from NEI don't always stack correctly.
* Added microblocks to NEI subset "Blocks.Microblocks" - so you can hide them from NEI.
* Added config option for auto-detection of valid blocks to make microblocks out of.
  Might not work well in SMP.
  Not all blocks are textured or named correctly.
  This lags NEI due to the sheer number of items.

52.3.6:
* Fixed the fix in 52.3.3 (where it crashes on startup when not installed as a coremod).

52.3.5:
* Fixed IC2 cables discoing when you punch them.

52.3.4:
* Fixed possible microblock-related client crash.

52.3.3:
* Fixed crash when not installed as a coremod.

52.3.2:
* Fixed a wrong obfuscated name.

52.3.1:
* Fixed a copy-paste derp

52.3.0:
* Immibis Core can now be installed as a coremod, instead of a normal mod.
* Added microblock transformer, only available when installed as a coremod. Cover ALL the things!
* Microblock switch moved to immibis-coremod.cfg (even when not a coremod) and defaults to true.
* Fixed previous fix.

52.2.6:
* Fixed crash when someone else breaks a cover within your view distance.

52.2.5:
* Probably fixed dark GUIs on some systems in Liquid XP (and maybe InfiniTubes)

52.2.4:
* Fixed previous update.

52.2.3:
* Fixed block and item IDs occasionally not being added to the config.

52.2.2:
* Disabled a sanity check when IDResolver is installed.
* IMPORTANT: Changed the way InfiniTubes IDs are assigned for consistency.
  The defaults have changed, and the option name in the config has changed (added .id to the end).
  Config should auto-convert but back it up just in case. 
  This only affects InfiniTubes.

52.2.1:
* Added part IDs to detailed item tooltips (F3+H)

52.2.0:
* Refactored microblock API.
* Improved handling of invalid microblock IDs.
* Allowed microblock IDs over 32767 by storing them in NBT. Old ones will not stack with new ones unless you place and break them.

52.1.0:
* Included some microblock fixes, and an experimental mod framework used by InfiniTubes.

52.0.5:
* Recompiled with Java 6.

52.0.4:
* Re-added missing registration of microblock tile entity. Existing placed microblocks will disappear. Sorry :( 

52.0.3:
* Fixed packaging again.

52.0.2:
* Fixed mcmod.info

52.0.1:
* Fixed packaging.

52.0.0:
* Updated to 1.4.6.
* For FML's ID mismatch detection, all blocks registered by my mods will count as being registered by Immibis Core,
  instead of sometimes Immibis Core and sometimes the actual mod. This may result in ID mismatch warnings the first
  time you load an old world, which can be safely ignored.
* API rearrangements.
* Blocks and items now use consistent default IDs based on the hashcode of their name. Before this, all blocks
  had the same default ID, which was pretty pointless as all but the first would get autoassigned.
  This might need to be changed again if it causes too many conflicts.

51.0.6:
* Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException caused by breaking the same part twice (caused by lag).
* Internal changes to microblock API.
* Added chiseled sandstone, smooth sandstone and redstone lamp microblocks.

51.0.5:
* Fixed microblocks not being placeable.
* "Microblock container" blocks with no microblocks in them will now destroy themselves.

51.0.4:
* Started changelog.
* Now splits packets bigger than 32kiB and reassembles them on the other end. (fixes Immibis's Peripherals speakers in SMP)
* Fixed an ID allocation typo which made it easier for conflicts to happen when adding new mods.
